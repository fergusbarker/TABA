This will be a simple program written in PHP and Javascript (Jquery) that will print randomised quotes from the novel "The Hobbit" written by J.R.R. Tolkien.

Some of this work is done by my good friend https://github.com/fergusbarker/ and I'm glad to have him help me and is such a good guy, oh man.
